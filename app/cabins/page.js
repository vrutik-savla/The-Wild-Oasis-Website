// 459. Experimenting With Caching and ISR
export const revalidate = 3600; //Here wee need to put exact value, no computation, for example 60*60 not allowed, instead write directly 3600
// This searchParams can of course also not be known at runtime, right? What this means is that whenever we make use of the searchParams, the page can no longer be statically rendered. So right now, this cabin's overview page will now always be dynamically rendered, meaning that what we have here, so this revalidate, this now no longer takes any effect because this only applies to statically generated pages, which makes sense, right? So there's no need to revalidate a page that is dynamic anyway. But I'll just leave this here because this is in the end just a learning project anyway. So this is really relevant in case you don't use searchParams or anything else that switches the page to dynamic rendering.
